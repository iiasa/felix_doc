# 8. Climate
The climate module in FeliX is based on the C-ROADS model (Sterman et al., 2012), which in turn refers to FREE model (Fiddaman, 2002) and DICE model (Nordhaus, 1994, 1992). The Earth's radiation budget is constrained to the temperature change due to carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), halocarbons and other forcings (e.g., aerosols, O3, etc.) CO2 emissions are endogenous variables as described in the section Carbon cycle. The rest of forcings are generated exogenously based on historical data and the future projections from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (Byers et al., 2022). The temperature change is governed by radiative forcings, feedback cooling due to outbound longwave radiation, and heat transfer from the atmosphere and upper ocean to deep ocean layers.
