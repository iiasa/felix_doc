# 6. Diet change
Food demand is quantified based on the total caloric demand for eight main food categories. Total caloric demand is based on dietary choices of different population segments. Population segments of dietary choices are represented by the followers of the meat-based and vegetarian diets for each age cohort and gender (Eker et al., 2019). The shifts between these two dietary choices depend on income (represented by GWP_per_Cap) and social and behavioral factors such as climate and health risk perception, self-efficacy and social norms that underly pro-environmental behavior.
Followers of meat-based and vegetarian diets are assumed to eat a standard mix of eight food categories. We used typical United States’ diets (Pimentel and Pimentel, 2003), a reference world diet and the global average supply statistics, as benchmarks to understand how meat-based and vegetarian diets differ globally. Based on such proportional differences of meat-based and vegetarian diets, we form the reference meat-based and vegetarian diets by decomposing the world’s average diet according to the population fraction of the two groups  .
