# Nomenclature

{: .note }
>  **Rules of thumb:**
>  1. Notations used in this FeliX documentation page are self-expressed as much as possible. We use $$Pop$$ to represent global population or $$GWP\_per\_Cap$$ to represent gross world product per capita. We also use abbreviations for some variables with long name, such as $$GWP$$ representing gross world product or $$LE$$ representing life expectancy. The full names of abbreviations are spelled out befor defining them.
>  2. Subscriptions are used to represent different values of one singe variable. Examples are $$Pop_{male,\text{“5‒9”}}$$ and $$Pop_{female,\text{“45‒49”}}$$ represent total population of male at the age between 5‒9 and total population of female at the age between 45‒49, respectively.
>  3. We use underscores to link two or more words in one notation and capitalize the first letter of each word except conjunction (e.g., per, of, on, and etc.) Examples are $$GWP\_per\_Cap$$ represents gross world product per capita.
>  4. Predefined functions in Vensim are represented by notations with capitalized letters, such as DELAY1 for the delay function.
>  5. Notations are listed by alphabet. The associated explanations and units (if any) are also listed in this page.
>  6. Please DO NOT hesitate to contact us for further questions and/or suggestions.
